This project continues the work of Aleksi Viljanen and here is his original repository. https://gitlab.com/aleksiviljanen/lineworld.git
I changed the approach of the edge detection to make it lighter and give more details so the application is more usable

To get this project up and running should not be too hard. It basically requires few things which are:

1) Downloading Android studio (version 3.6 or newer is required)
2) Following any compilation errors given by Android Studio if there is any

Errors occuring in step 2 might be something to do with used environment and its requirements/settings
